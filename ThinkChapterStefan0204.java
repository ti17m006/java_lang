/*
 * Create a new program called ThinkChapter0204.java. 
 * 
 * Create variables named hour, minute, 
 * and second. Assign values that are roughly the 
 * current time. Use a 24-hour clock so that at 2pm 
 * the value of hour is 14.
 * 
 * Make the program calculate and display the number 
 * of seconds since midnight.
 * 
 * Calculate and display the number of seconds remaining in the day.
 * 
 * Calculate and display the percentage of the day that has 
 * passed. You might run into problems when computing percentages with
 * integers, so consider using floating-point.
 * 
 * Change the values of hour , minute , and second to reflect 
 * the current time. Then write code to compute the elapsed 
 * time since you started working on this exercise.
